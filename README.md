# Bits Battle
The odd and even numbers are fighting against each other!

You are given a list of positive integers. The odd numbers from the list will fight using their 1 bits from their binary representation, while the even numbers will fight using their 0 bits. If present in the list, number 0 will be neutral, hence not fight for either side.

You should return:

odds win if number of 1s from odd numbers is larger than 0s from even numbers
evens win if number of 1s from odd numbers is smaller than 0s from even numbers
tie if equal, including if list is empty
Please note that any prefix that might appear in the binary representation, e.g. 0b, should not be counted towards the battle.

Example:
For an input list of [5, 3, 14]:

odds: 5 and 3 => 101 and 11 => four 1s
evens: 14 => 1110 => one 0
Result: odds win the battle with 4-1

## Worl Bits War

Variation of BITS BATTLE kata, the war has expanded and become dirtier and meaner; both even and odd numbers will fight with their pointy 1s. And negative integers are coming into play as well, with, Ã§a va sans dire, a negative contribution (think of them as spies or saboteurs).

A number's strength is determined by the number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation. Negative integers work against their own side so their strength is negative. For example -5 = -101 has strength -2 and +5 = +101 has strength +2.

The side with the largest cumulated strength wins.

Again, three possible outcomes: odds win, evens win and tie.

Examples:

```javascript
bitsWar([1,5,12]) => "odds win" //1+101 vs 1100, 3 vs 2
bitsWar([7,-3,20]) => "evens win" //111-11 vs 10100, 3-2 vs 2
bitsWar([7,-3,-2,6]) => "tie" //111-11 vs -1+110, 3-2 vs -1+2
```

## Remove Zeros

Write a function that takes an array of values and moves all elements that are zero to the end of the array, otherwise preserving the order of the array. The zero elements must also maintain the order in which they occurred.

For example, the following array
```javascript
[7, 2, 3, 0, 4, 6, 0, 0, 13, 0, 78, 0, 0, 19, 14]
```

is transformed into
```javascript
[7, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13, 78, 19, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Zero elements are defined by either 0 or "0". Some tests may include elements that are not number literals.

You are NOT allowed to use any temporary arrays or objects. You are also not allowed to use any Array.prototype or Object.prototype methods.

## Frequency sequence

Return an output string that translates an input string s/$s by replacing each character in s/$s with a number representing the number of times that character occurs in s/$s and separating each number with the character(s) sep/$sep.

```javascript
freq_seq("hello world", "-"); // => "1-1-3-3-2-1-1-2-1-3-1"
freq_seq("19999999", ":"); // => "1:7:7:7:7:7:7:7"
freq_seq("^^^**$", "x"); // => "3x3x3x2x2x1"
```

## ASCII hex converter

Write a module Converter that can take ASCII text and convert it to hexadecimal. The class should also be able to take hexadecimal and convert it to ASCII text. To make the conversion well defined, each ASCII character is represented by exactly two hex digits, left-padding with a 0 if needed. The conversion from ascii to hex should produce lowercase strings (i.e. f6 instead of F6).

Example

```javascript
Converter.toHex("Look mom, no hands")
=> "4c6f6f6b206d6f6d2c206e6f2068616e6473"

Converter.toAscii("4c6f6f6b206d6f6d2c206e6f2068616e6473")
=> "Look mom, no hands"
```

## Extra file with operations with arrays (it is not a kata)

In this file you will find some operations with arrays.

```javascript
//IntersecciÃ³n
var c = a.filter(function(v){ return b.indexOf(v) > -1 })
//SustracciÃ³n
var d = a.filter(function(v){ return b.indexOf(v) == -1 })
//Complemento
var e = a.filter(function(v){ return !(b.indexOf(v) > -1) })
 .concat(b.filter(function(v){ return !(a.indexOf(v) > -1)}))
//UniÃ³n
var f = a.concat(b.filter(function(v){ return !(a.indexOf(v) > -1)}));
```
